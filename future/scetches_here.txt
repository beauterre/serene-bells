I am just doing some changes to the interface, want to keep it non-religious, agnostic of any "method". 
To be used with any..

Also on a technical level, I am going to make it a "real" PWA, in the options you'll find an install button for offline usage.
The playing styles will be presets, putting all options in place, but you'll be able to vary a lot more in the options for adaptability for a particular use.
