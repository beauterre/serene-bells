# What is serene-bells?
An autogenerated pure, tuned bell/gong meditation sound that you can set to a specific time.
It will begin and end with a recognisable, pleasant sound.

It won´t get too boring, because of chord changes, not too interesting, because the chord changes aren´t very often.
And the chords are chosen to be open.. Lower notes are more probable than higher ones.
For the gong sound I used a dual sine wave with a slight frequency difference.
And for this "instrument" I made 16 polyfonic registers.
With some tweaking, you´ll get different instruments or chords, happy modding.

## Settings
I had to create some settings, since people noticed the phones and tablets shut off after a while.
There is now a NO-SLEEP setting, using the nosleep.js library.
I might just make it default, it doesn´t eat much..

## Further developments include:
 - auto start on the wake-lock.
 - reduced polyphony, because on some phones we get unwanted noise
 - white, brown, pink etc noise integration (requires some research on my part). I would like to generate non-looping running water, fire or rain sounds. [Auhm experiment](https://hjalmarsnoep.github.io/zen-air-bells/endless-auhm.html) 
 - possibly calming visualisations?

### keeping your device awake
I owe a debt of gratitude to [no_sleep.js by Richtr](https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js/)
I would have NEVER figured that out..

## APPRECIATION:
I do these things because I find them useful, I share, because you might.
If you do, you can show that by donating money, effort, time or a kind word and I will appreciate it very much.
